### Overview

This is a fun little take on Trivia.  I could not think of any questions or answers so I wanted to create a list of questions and answers that made absolutely no sense.

This is written in basic HTML using some Bootstrap, a little CSS, Javascript and Jquery.  

Instructions:  

- Press Start Game
- Answer the question before the timer runs out
- If the timer runs out before you answer the question, the correct answer is displayed for a few seconds and the next
question is displayed.  
- You only get one chance to answer each question
- At the end, the correct answers are tallied as well as the wrong answers and the amount of time you used to answer the questions in total.
